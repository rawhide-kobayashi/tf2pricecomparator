# tf2pricecomparator

A python project to gather live (approximately) pricing data from various TF2 marketplaces and display arbitrage potential.  Maybe even trade.

These instructions assume a cursory familiarity with Google search.

This project depends on, and will automatically install https://github.com/ekisu/tf2-metalbot to manage metal crafting.  You must install nodejs/NPM prior to the first run through whatever method your OS requires.

You must make a copy of template.settings.json as settings.json and fill it out before starting this script.  You need a backpack.tf API key, steam API key, steam account username and password, and the relative path to an unencrypted authenticator file from Steam Desktop Authenticator.
